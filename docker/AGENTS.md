# Docker DOX

## Purpose

- Own Docker build contexts and runtime container definitions.
- Keep framework runtime, agent execution runtime, exposed ports, mounted paths, and image build assumptions explicit.

## Ownership

- `base/` owns the base image context.
- `run/` owns the runnable image context and upstream-style compose file.
- `symbolics/` owns the local a0-symbolics compose wrapper, persistent Nix store, and reusable Home Manager seed.
- Root `DockerfileLocal` is owned by the root contract but must stay compatible with this directory.

## Local Contracts

- Preserve the two-runtime model: the Python 3.12 framework runtime under `/opt/venv-a0` runs the WebUI, APIs, scheduler, framework imports, and plugin hooks; the Python 3.13 agent execution runtime under `/opt/venv` runs agent terminal tasks and user code.
- Verify backend imports and plugin hooks with `/opt/venv-a0`; packages installed into `/opt/venv` do not prove framework compatibility.
- Do not bake secrets, local `.env` values, or user data into images.
- Keep compose mounts aligned with `usr/` and other runtime-state expectations.
- The symbolics compose path persists only `/nix` and `/a0/usr`; application code remains image-owned so updates cannot be masked by a stale persistent `/a0` tree.
- `initialize.sh` restores persisted home entries from `A0_PERSISTENT_HOME_DIR` (default `/a0/usr/home`) into `$A0_HOME_DIR` after Home Manager activation; non-empty image-/Home-Manager-owned targets win.
- Image changes that affect GitHub publishing must stay synchronized with `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`.

## Work Guidance

- Keep Dockerfile steps cache-friendly and explicit about which runtime they target.
- Avoid broad copies of ignored runtime folders.
- Update setup docs when ports, volumes, startup commands, or runtime layout change.

## Verification

- Build the affected Docker context when Docker behavior changes.
- Run Docker-related tests or startup smoke checks when changing runtime entrypoints.
